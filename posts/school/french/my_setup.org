* French 209

Throughout French 209 I used OneNote (from the Microsoft Store) for study notes.
I would create a page for each class and for each new vocabulary item I would
write the English version then the French version indented beneath. This way I
could use OneNote's folding feature while I studied as a kind of flashcard
system.

** Positives

This system worked quite well. It's main advantages were:
- Easy organization and searching of notes with OneNote's sections and pages and
  configurable search.
- Quick and accessible translation with OneNote's built-in translator.
- Built-in spell-checking of multiple languages.
- Folding of indented regions providing flashcard-like studying.
- The ability to hand-write

** Negatives

The lack of any built-in Vim emulation in OneNote is a big negative for me. I
have become accustomed to the navigation, editing, and tools provided by Vim,
and moving from coding in Vim to writing anything longer than a few sentences is
always painful. I tried to use external Vim emulation through an Auto Hot Key
script, but I think that was probably doomed from the start as it created many
conflicting keys, lacked many features, and was buggy in the features it did
have.

* French 213

** Emacs with Spacemacs and Org-Mode

*** Setting up

I am starting French 213 in the winter term and I aim to improve on my setup by
using Emacs instead of OneNote. Near the end of last term I switched over to
Emacs (and more specifically Spacemacs) from Vim. Spacemacs provides
excellent Vim emulation in Emacs (primarily through evil-mode), so that solves
the main negative I had with OneNote. The difficult part would be keeping the
positives.

Right off the bat a few of the positives are provided for me:
- Organization would be provided by the file system as I'm creating files
  directly.
- There are more options for searching in Emacs than I could ever need
  so that won't be an issue.
- Text folding in Org-Mode is built-in and excellent.

So my main concerns will be translation and spell-checking of multiple
languages.

**** Translation

OneNote's built-in translation was extremely useful as I could select some text,
translate it, then insert the translated text directly into my notes from one
application. OneNote's options for automation and keyboard shortcuts are lacking
though so I did have to use the mouse quite a bit in this process.

Thankfully, Spacemacs (at least on the develop branch) has Google translation
built-in, so I should be able to do what I did in OneNote and automate any
repetitive translation tasks I might have through Elisp and macros.

**** Spell-checking

In OneNote I could use multiple languages in the same document fairly
effortlessly. In order to this, however, I would have to ensure that I had the
correct language set on my computer (thankfully Windows provides the ~ALT-SHIFT~
keyboard shortcut for this), and if I forgot to do this I would have to go
through the slow process of selecting the text I just typed then selecting the
menu item to change the language of that text.

This wasn't awful, but Spacemacs' Spell-Checking layer seemed like it would be
an improvement. However, it would prove the most difficult to set up: I started
by adding ~spell-checking~ to ~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ in
~~/.spacemacs~. This provided English spell-checking (thank you Spacemacs). Next
I needed to set up spell-checking for multiple languages. The [[https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+checkers/spell-checking/README.html][spell-check layer documentation]]
recommends using Hunspell by adding this snippet to ~user-config~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load "ispell"
    (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell")
    ;; ispell-set-spellchecker-params has to be called
    ;; before ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic will work
    (ispell-set-spellchecker-params)
    (ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic "pl_PL,en_GB")
    (setq ispell-dictionary "pl_PL,en_GB"))
#+end_src
So I added the snippet and installed Hunspell with
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt-get install hunspell
#+END_SRC
I then started receiving the error: "~Symbolâ€™s function definition is void:
ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic~". So I googled it and learned that older versions
of Emacs' ~ispell.el~ did not support the functionality I was trying to use with
this function. However, I didn't think this could be the problem because I was
using a very recent version of Emacs (26.3), and I had the function definition
in my local ~/usr/share/emacs/26.3/lisp/textmodes/ispell.el~.

After a while of being confused, I did what I should have done in the first
place and I went to the ~ispell~ file that Emacs was actually using by calling
~spacemacs/jump-to-definition~ while my cursor was on ~ispell-program-name~.
This revealed that Emacs was using a file in ~/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/~
instead of the file I expected, and this file was an old version.

At this point I tried to delete this old file, hoping that Emacs would then use
the right file, but this broke Emacs and it wouldn't run. So, because I had no
idea what I broke or how to fix it, I uninstalled Emacs, deleted
~/usr/share/emacs~, called ~sudo-apt-autoremove~, reinstalled Emacs, and all was
well.

Once that error was fixed I had to figure out how to install and use
dictionaries, and after a while of googling and not finding what I was looking
for, I ran
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt search hunspell
#+END_SRC
and found that I could install the dictionaries I wanted with
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt-get install hunspell-en-ca
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt-get install hunspell-fr
#+END_SRC
I then updated my dictionaries to ~en_CA,fr_FR~, restarted Emacs because it
wasn't recognizing the newly installed dictionaries, and I had spell-checking in
multiple languages.

**** Hand-writing

I used OneNote's drawing feature to practice physically writing out the French
words, as this helps me remember them. However, I will have to give up the
ability to hand-write in the same application as my notes if I am to switch to
Emacs. I'm okay with this because I believe typing out the words will have the
same effect as writing them, but if I notice a drop in my grades I can always
use OneNote to write as I study.
